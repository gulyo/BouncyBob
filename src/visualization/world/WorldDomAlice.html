    It was one of those rare antemeridian summer breezes which are not particularly cold, but already bear the promise
    of a colorful autumn that made Alice stop in her walk. She got really exited looking down, for she found a
    flower that even she doubted could exist. It was a SameFlower.<br />
    SameFlowers are extremely rare and exist in pairs - so finding one you can be sure there is another flower that is
    exactly the same. Alice saw it instantly that this one was the same to the last tiny bit, so she started looking
    for its pair.<br />
    Doing so she wandered to the muddy bank of the near creek. Now SameFlowers have strange powers, so when she
    slipped second time, she actually stepped into the same river twice, which phenomenon transported her to Paralland
    in a blink. (To be precise it was multiple blinks that happened in seconds that were the same, but fortunately
    Alice never realized that.)<br />
    She somewhat got used to strange places, but in Paralland she felt herself absolutely centered. Literally.
    A lot of worlds surrounded her simultaneously, and when she took a step she always remained at the same position,
    but all the worlds started moving around her.<br />
    She considered this slightly confusing.
