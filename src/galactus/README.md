# Galactus

The application will create one instance of **Galactus** at startup. It
creates a simple selector, and on user interaction it will create the
selected **World**.

## Nintendo classic

Good old Earth gravity in two dimensions with fully elastic walls.

## Into the Box

A third elastic dimension added to **Nintendo classic**.

## Seriously Versatil Game-engine

The same as **Nintendo classic**, but with SVG graphics.

## Log Ann's run

A log based world - open the Javascript console to see the output.

It's five dimensional with multiple **Absorptions** and **Gravities**
just because we can do it.
